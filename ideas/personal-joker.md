# Personal Jokers

## Description
Each player receives a unique, personal joker card at the beginning of the game that only they can use.

## Rules
- At the start of the game, each player is dealt one card face-down from a special deck
- This card serves as that player's personal joker for the entire game session
- The personal joker can replace any card (like a standard joker)
- Only the player who received the joker can use it
- Personal jokers remain with players even when they fold (not discarded)

## Variations
- **Signature Jokers**: Players design/choose their personal joker before the game starts
- **Evolving Jokers**: Personal jokers gain additional abilities after certain game milestones
- **Tradable Jokers**: Players can trade their personal jokers during specified times

## Strategy Notes
- Creates unique asymmetric gameplay since each player has different capabilities
- Adds a layer of bluffing - opponents won't know your personal joker's value
- Consider revealing your personal joker as a power move to intimidate opponents

## Edge Cases & Troubleshooting
- **Joker Loss**: If a player accidentally reveals their personal joker, they still keep it
- **Multiple Games**: Decide whether players keep the same personal joker across multiple hands
- **Balance Issues**: For games with players of different skill levels, adjust personal joker power accordingly
