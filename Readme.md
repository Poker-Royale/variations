### AK47

**Description**: A variant where specific card ranks become jokers.

**Setup**:
- Standard poker setup (2 hole cards, 5 community cards)
- All Aces (A), Kings (K), Fours (4), and Sevens (7) are designated as jokers

**Gameplay**:
- Betting proceeds as in standard poker
- Any A, K, 4, or 7 functions as a joker and can represent any card
- The specific designation of these four ranks creates a unique distribution of wild cards

**Card Rankings**:
- Standard poker hand rankings apply with the addition of Five of a Kind
- Five of a Kind beats Four of a Kind but loses to Straight Flush
- When comparing identical hands, jokers adopt the most advantageous value
- In the case of multiple Five of a Kinds, the highest-value five of a kind wins

**Variations**:
- **AK47 Deluxe**: Include jokers from the deck as additional wild cards
- **AK47 Selective**: Players choose one of the four ranks (A, K, 4, or 7) at the start of each hand to be wild for them
- **AK47 Progressive**: Each round, the joker designation rotates (A, K, 4, 7, then A&K, 4&7, then A&4, K&7, etc.)

**Edge Cases & Troubleshooting**:
- **Multiple Jokers**: If a player has multiple jokers, each can represent a different card
- **Identical Hands**: If two players have identical hands with jokers, the jokers are considered to have the same value
- **Split Pots**: More common in this variant; be prepared to divide chips
- **Suits with Jokers**: When a joker represents a card of a specific suit, that suit can be used multiple times

**Strategy Notes**:
- With multiple jokers possible, expect stronger hands overall
- Consider the probabilities of drawing jokers (4 of each rank = 16 total potential jokers)
- Adjust your betting strategy knowing that many medium-strength hands can be improved with jokers# ADVANCED POKER VARIANTS RULEBOOK

## INTRODUCTION

This rulebook outlines a collection of innovative poker variants created by the "Done" poker collective â€“ a group of friends (Dhruv, Shivam, Sarthak, Swapnil, and Saksham) who have taken the classic game and transformed it through creative experimentation.

Born from a desire to keep the game fresh and unpredictable, these variants introduce special cards and unique mechanics that create strategic depth beyond traditional poker play. Each variant can be played as a standalone game or combined with others for more complex gameplay.

The "Done" collection represents years of refinement, resulting in a rich poker ecosystem that rewards both skill and adaptability.

Whether you're looking to spice up your regular poker night or dive into a completely transformed game, these variants offer something for every type of player.

## BASE POKER RULES

All variants build upon the foundation of standard poker rules:

- **Players**: 2-10 players
- **Deck**: Standard 52-card deck, plus any special cards as specified by the variant
- **Objective**: Win chips by having the best hand or by forcing other players to fold
- **Hand Rankings** (from lowest to highest):
  1. High Card
  2. One Pair
  3. Two Pair
  4. Three of a Kind
  5. Straight
  6. Flush
  7. Full House
  8. Four of a Kind
  9. Straight Flush
  10. Royal Flush

- **Basic Play**:
  1. Players are dealt cards face-down (hole cards)
  2. Community cards are dealt face-up in the center
  3. Betting rounds occur between deals
  4. Players make the best 5-card hand using their hole cards and the community cards
  5. The best hand wins the pot

Unless otherwise specified, all variants follow the standard betting structure (blinds, raises, etc.) of Texas Hold'em.

## SPECIAL CARDS

### Jokers

**Description**: Jokers are wild cards that can represent any card of any suit to create the strongest possible hand.

**Rules**:
- A joker can substitute for any card of any rank and suit
- Multiple jokers can be used to represent different cards
- When determining hand strength, jokers are assigned the most advantageous value for the holder

**Card Rankings**:
- Jokers enable Five of a Kind hands, which rank above Four of a Kind but below Straight Flush
- When comparing identical hands, natural cards take precedence over joker-created combinations
- If two players have the same hand value using jokers, the player using fewer jokers wins
- For identical hands with the same number of jokers, standard tie-breaking rules apply

**Variations**:
- **Limited Jokers**: Jokers can only substitute for certain ranks or suits
- **Conditional Jokers**: Jokers have different powers based on the phase of the game
- **Penalty Jokers**: Using jokers incurs a penalty (e.g., must discard another card)
- **Joker Draft**: Players select which jokers they want from a pool before the hand begins

**Edge Cases & Troubleshooting**:
- **Multiple Jokers for Same Card**: Two jokers cannot represent the same specific card
- **Suits with Jokers**: When a joker represents a card of a specific suit, that suit can be used multiple times in the same hand
- **Joker Transitions**: In games with dynamic jokers, establish clear rules about when joker designations change
- **Joker Identification**: Clearly mark joker cards to distinguish them from regular cards
- **Dealer Verification**: Dealer should verify joker usage is valid
- **Hand Declaration**: Players must declare how they're using jokers at showdown
- **Ambiguous Usage**: If a joker could create multiple equally valuable hands, the player chooses which interpretation to use

**Strategy Notes**:
- Save jokers for completing high-value hands like straights and flushes
- Consider the mathematical probability of drawing needed cards vs. using jokers immediately
- Watch betting patterns to infer opponents' joker usage
- Bluffing with jokers can be particularly effective

### Cobra Cards

**Description**: Cobra cards allow players to steal cards from others.

**Rules**:
- When played, a Cobra card allows the player to take one card from any other player, the deck, or the community cards
- The stolen card becomes part of the player's hand

- If a Cobra was used to steal a joker or special card, that card retains its special properties

**Variations**:
- **Blind Cobra**: Player must declare target (player/community/deck) before seeing the card
- **Double Cobra**: A player can use two Cobras to exchange one of their cards with an opponent's
- **Defensive Cobra**: Can be played on someone else's turn to block another Cobra or Viper
- **Cobra King**: The first player to successfully use a Cobra gets an additional action

**Edge Cases & Troubleshooting**:
- **Timing**: Cobra cards can only be played before the showdown, typically during betting rounds
- **Multiple Cobras**: If multiple players have Cobras, establish a priority order (e.g., clockwise from dealer)
- **Stealing Special Cards**: A stolen special card (joker, viper, etc.) retains its properties
- **Empty Hands**: Cannot steal from a player who has already played all their cards
- **Community Protection**: Some games may restrict stealing certain community cards

**Done Group Insight**: *"The Cobra concept came after Swapnil's legendary complaining about bad hands. 'I wish I could just take your cards!' he shouted at Sarthak one night. Five minutes later, we were sketching out the rules on a napkin. Now it's Swapnil who fears the Cobra most. There's nothing funnier than watching someone's face when their perfect ace gets snatched just before the river."* the community cards

### Viper Cards

**Description**: Viper cards force opponents to redraw their hands.

**Rules**:
- When played, a Viper card forces a targeted player to discard their entire hand and draw a new one from the deck
- The targeted player has no choice in this exchange
- Viper cards must be played during the player's turn
- Once played, the Viper card is discarded

**Card Rankings**:
- Standard poker hand rankings apply
- Hands created after a Viper redraw have the same value as original hands
- No special ranking considerations apply for hands affected by Viper cards

**Variations**:
- **Selective Viper**: Target discards and redraws only a portion of their hand (e.g., 1 card)
- **Reflective Viper**: Target can "reflect" the Viper back to another player by revealing a special card
- **Community Viper**: Forces a redraw of some or all community cards instead of targeting a player
- **Venom Viper**: Target must discard their hand but doesn't get to redraw

**Edge Cases & Troubleshooting**:
- **Timing**: Viper cards can only be played before the showdown, typically during betting rounds
- **Multiple Vipers**: If multiple players have Vipers, establish a priority order (e.g., clockwise from dealer)
- **Deck Depletion**: If there aren't enough cards to redraw a complete hand, reshuffle the discard pile
- **Viper After Cobra**: If a player has used a Cobra to steal a card, that card is included in the forced discard
- **Special Card Protection**: Some games may allow certain cards to be immune to Viper effects
- **Blinds Adjustment**: Player affected by a Viper late in the game may have adjusted blind obligations
- **Failed Viper**: If a player attempts to use a Viper illegally, they lose their turn and the Viper
- **Dealer Handling**: Dealer must ensure the discard and redraw process is fair and random

**Strategy Notes**:
- Use Vipers against players showing strong betting patterns
- The uncertainty introduced by Vipers can create psychological advantages
- Consider the stage of the game - early Vipers disrupt initial strategy, late Vipers can be devastating
- Watch for players who seem unhappy with their hands - they make good Viper targets

### BS Cards

**Description**: BS cards allow players to switch different card sets.

**Rules**:
- When played, a BS card allows the player to switch between:
  - Joker row and community row
  - Cobra row and community row
  - Cobra row and joker row
- This switch is only valid when the number of cards in each row is equal
- After the switch, gameplay continues with the new configuration
- BS cards must be played during the player's turn

**Card Rankings**:
- Standard poker hand rankings apply
- Hands created after a BS switch have the same value as original hands
- The switch doesn't affect the intrinsic value of the cards, only their location and function

**Variations**:
- **Partial BS**: Player can switch only a portion of the rows (e.g., 2 out of 5 cards)
- **BS Reversal**: Can be played to undo a previous BS switch
- **Double BS**: Switch both chosen rows with a third row
- **BS Block**: Can be played defensively to prevent another player's switch

**Edge Cases & Troubleshooting**:
- **Timing**: BS cards can only be played before the showdown, during betting rounds
- **Multiple BS Cards**: If multiple players have BS cards, establish a priority order
- **Unequal Rows**: If rows have unequal numbers of cards, players must specify which subset of cards to switch
- **Complex Setups**: In games with multiple special card types, clearly establish which rows can be switched
- **Card Function Transition**: When cards switch rows, they adopt the function of their new row
- **Row Identification**: Clearly mark or arrange rows to prevent confusion after switches
- **Failed BS**: If a player attempts an invalid switch, they lose their turn and the BS card
- **Dealer Verification**: Dealer should verify that switches are valid and executed correctly

**Strategy Notes**:
- BS cards create dramatic swings in game dynamics
- Use them to disrupt opponents who are relying heavily on a particular row
- The threat of a BS card can be as powerful as actually playing it
- Consider the timing - early BS plays change strategy, late BS plays can be game-winning

### Mamba Cards

**Description**: Mamba cards are ultra-rare cards that grant tremendous power to reshape the game.

**Rules**:
- Mamba cards are determined by drawing 2 cards from a separate deck - the exact matching cards (same suit and rank) in the main deck become the designated Mamba cards
- For example, if a 4 of Hearts and Jack of Spades are drawn from the separate deck, then only the 4 of Hearts and Jack of Spades in the main playing deck are Mamba cards
- When played, a Mamba card allows the player to replace any or all community cards, jokers, or special cards in play
- Discarded cards are removed from the game and replaced with new draws from the deck
- Mamba cards represent the most powerful intervention possible
- Mamba cards must be played during the player's turn

**Special Accumulation Rules**:
- Each game begins with 2 designated Mamba cards
- If no Mamba card is used during a complete poker hand, another Mamba card is added to the next hand
- Mamba cards continue to accumulate until used
- If even a single Mamba card is matched and used during a hand, all existing Mamba cards are removed and replaced with exactly 2 new Mamba cards for the next hand
- This creates a natural tension between the growing power (more Mamba cards) and the risk of them being reset

**Card Rankings**:
- The Mamba card itself has no special ranking for hand evaluation
- Its power lies in changing the game state, not in direct hand composition
- Hands created after Mamba effects follow standard ranking rules

**Variations**:
- **Targeted Mamba**: Can only replace specific types of cards (e.g., only community cards)
- **Democratic Mamba**: All players vote on which cards to replace
- **Controlled Mamba**: Player can choose specific replacement cards rather than random draws
- **Time Mamba**: Resets the game to a previous state rather than replacing cards

**Edge Cases & Troubleshooting**:
- **Mamba Identification**: Clearly identify which cards are Mamba cards at the start of each hand
- **Multiple Mambas**: If a player holds multiple Mamba cards, they can use them separately or together
- **Deck Depletion**: If the deck runs low on cards for replacements, reshuffle discards
- **Targeting Restrictions**: Mamba cannot target cards in players' hands except the user's own cards
- **Replacement Order**: Establish clear order for multiple card replacements
- **Dealer Verification**: Dealer must verify Mamba card matches designation before effect is applied
- **Failed Mamba**: If a player claims a Mamba incorrectly, they lose their turn and may face penalties
- **Accumulation Tracking**: Keep clear track of how many Mamba cards are active in each hand

**Strategy Notes**:
- The potential of accumulated Mamba cards can significantly influence betting strategies
- Consider whether to use a Mamba early (less powerful but preserves uncertainty) or late (more targeted impact)
- The reset mechanism creates situations where players might intentionally avoid using a Mamba
- Bluffing about having a Mamba can be as effective as actually having one

### Wild (Gecko) Cards

**Description**: Gecko cards are versatile wild cards that can transform into any snake card type.

**Rules**:
- When played, a Gecko card can function as either a Cobra, Viper, or BS card
- The player must declare which snake card type they're using the Gecko as when played
- Once declared, the Gecko card follows all rules of the chosen snake card type for that play
- After use, the Gecko card is discarded
- Gecko cards must be played during the player's turn
- Gecko cards cannot transform into Mamba cards

**Card Rankings**:
- The Gecko card itself has no special ranking
- Its effect on hand rankings depends on which snake card function it adopts
- Once transformed, it follows all ranking implications of that snake card type

**Variations**:
- **Dual Gecko**: Can function as two different snake cards simultaneously
- **Lingering Gecko**: Effect continues for multiple rounds
- **Chameleon Gecko**: Can change its function after initially being played
- **Gecko Plus**: Can also transform into jokers in addition to snake cards

**Edge Cases & Troubleshooting**:
- **Declaration Timing**: Player must declare the Gecko's function before using it
- **Function Limitations**: Gecko can only mimic the basic functions of snake cards, not their variations
- **Interaction with Other Cards**: A Gecko used as a Cobra can steal another Gecko
- **Failed Transformation**: If a player attempts an invalid transformation, they lose their turn and the Gecko
- **Identification**: Clearly mark Gecko cards to distinguish them from regular cards
- **Mamba Restriction**: Gecko cards explicitly cannot function as Mamba cards under any circumstances
- **Dealer Verification**: Dealer should verify transformations are valid
- **Simultaneous Geckos**: If multiple players use Geckos in the same round, resolve in clockwise order from dealer

**Strategy Notes**:
- The Gecko's flexibility makes it one of the most versatile cards
- Save it for critical moments when you need a specific snake card effect
- Opponents won't know which function you'll choose until you play it
- The threat of a potential Viper or BS effect can influence betting patterns

## GAME VARIATIONS

### AK47

**Description**: A variant where specific card ranks become jokers.

**Setup**:
- Standard poker setup (2 hole cards, 5 community cards)
- All Aces (A), Kings (K), Fours (4), and Sevens (7) are designated as jokers

**Gameplay**:
- Betting proceeds as in standard poker
- Any A, K, 4, or 7 functions as a joker and can represent any card
- The specific designation of these four ranks creates a unique distribution of wild cards

**Card Rankings**:
- Standard poker hand rankings apply with the addition of Five of a Kind
- Five of a Kind beats Four of a Kind but loses to Straight Flush
- When comparing identical hands, jokers adopt the most advantageous value
- In the case of multiple Five of a Kinds, the highest-value five of a kind wins

**Variations**:
- **AK47 Deluxe**: Include jokers from the deck as additional wild cards
- **AK47 Selective**: Players choose one of the four ranks (A, K, 4, or 7) at the start of each hand to be wild for them
- **AK47 Progressive**: Each round, the joker designation rotates (A, K, 4, 7, then A&K, 4&7, then A&4, K&7, etc.)

**Edge Cases & Troubleshooting**:
- **Multiple Jokers**: If a player has multiple jokers, each can represent a different card
- **Identical Hands**: If two players have identical hands with jokers, the jokers are considered to have the same value
- **Split Pots**: More common in this variant; be prepared to divide chips
- **Suits with Jokers**: When a joker represents a card of a specific suit, that suit can be used multiple times

**Strategy Notes**:
- With multiple jokers possible, expect stronger hands overall
- Consider the probabilities of drawing jokers (4 of each rank = 16 total potential jokers)
- Adjust your betting strategy knowing that many medium-strength hands can be improved with jokers

**Done Group Insight**: *"This variant was born during a 3AM session when Shivam said he was bored with waiting for good hands. We picked A and K because they're high cards, and 4 and 7 because, well, AK47. Shivam went on an absolute rampage the first time we played it. We now use it to kick off our poker nights â€“ it gets the chips moving fast."*

### Range Jokers

**Description**: This variant introduces jokers based on a range of revealed cards.

**Setup**:
- Two random cards are revealed from the deck
- All cards with ranks between these two revealed cards become jokers

**Rules**:
- The range can be either inclusive (including the revealed cards) or exclusive (only cards between)
- The dealer must specify whether the game uses the "short range" or "long range":
  - Short range: The span containing fewer cards between the revealed cards
  - Long range: The span containing more cards between the revealed cards
- For example, if a 3 and 8 are revealed:
  - Short range: 4, 5, 6, 7 become jokers (exclusive) or 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 become jokers (inclusive)
  - Long range: 9, 10, J, Q, K, A, 2 become jokers (exclusive) or 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A, 2 become jokers (inclusive)

**Card Rankings**:
- Standard poker hand rankings apply with Five of a Kind possible
- When comparing identical hands with jokers, the natural cards take precedence
- If two players use jokers to create the same hand value, the player with more natural cards wins
- If both hands have the same number of jokers, standard tie-breaking rules apply

**Variations**:
- **Range Reversal**: Cards outside the range become jokers instead
- **Range Freeze**: The range is determined pre-flop and remains fixed for the entire game session
- **Range Swap**: Halfway through the hand, the range flips (what was in range becomes out, what was out becomes in)
- **Suit Range**: In addition to rank range, a suit range is also specified (e.g., all cards between Hearts and Spades)

**Edge Cases & Troubleshooting**:
- **Boundary Cards**: Be clear about inclusive vs. exclusive before starting
- **Same Rank Cards**: If both range-defining cards are the same rank (e.g., two 8s), only that rank is considered in range for inclusive, while for exclusive there is no range
- **Empty Range**: If cards create an empty range in exclusive mode, redraw range cards
- **Ace High/Low**: Decide before play whether Ace is treated as high, low, or both for range purposes
- **Range Wrap-around**: For determining short vs. long range, clarify whether the range wraps around (Aâ†’Kâ†’Qâ†’...â†’2â†’A)

**Strategy Notes**:
- Pay close attention to the range limits when planning your strategy
- Sometimes a narrow range is more beneficial than a wide one if it includes key cards

### Regret Jokers

**Description**: Players create jokers through their discarded cards.

**Setup**:
- Each player is dealt one extra hole card (e.g., 3 in Hold'em instead of 2)
- Each player must discard one card
- The discarded cards are shuffled and become jokers

**Rules**:
- Discarded cards are revealed alongside community cards (one joker per community card)
- If there are more discards than community cards, the excess cards are not used
- If there are fewer discards than community cards, additional cards are drawn from the deck to serve as jokers for the remaining community cards
- Each joker is paired with a specific community card

**Card Rankings**:
- Standard poker hand rankings apply with Five of a Kind possible
- If multiple players have the same hand type using jokers, the player using fewer jokers wins
- For identical hands with the same number of jokers, standard tie-breaking rules apply
- Five of a Kind rank is determined by the natural card value (e.g., five Kings beats five Queens)

**Variations**:
- **Regret Choice**: Players can choose which community card their discard becomes paired with
- **Regret Return**: At showdown, players can reclaim their discarded card by sacrificing one of their hole cards
- **Regret Stack**: Jokers are revealed all at once and players can choose which to use
- **Synchronized Regret**: All players must discard the same rank (but different suits)

**Edge Cases & Troubleshooting**:
- **No Communal Discard**: A player cannot use their own discarded card as a joker
- **Missing Cards**: If deck runs out of cards for jokers, reshuffle the muck pile
- **Dealer Discard**: The dealer must also discard if playing, even though they deal the cards
- **Revealing Order**: Establish a consistent order for revealing jokers with community cards
- **Paired Jokers**: If a joker matches the value of its paired community card, it should be treated as any other card of that value 

**Strategy Notes**:
- Consider discarding cards that would create advantageous jokers
- Be aware that your discard might help opponents more than yourself
- Watch which cards others discard for clues about their hands

### Regret Community

**Description**: A variant where discarded cards form the community.

**Setup**:
- Each player is dealt extra hole cards (typically 3-4 more than normal)
- Each player must discard cards equal to the number of community cards needed (typically 5)
- The discarded cards are shuffled and become the community cards

**Rules**:
- Community cards are revealed per standard poker rules (flop, turn, river)
- Players use their remaining hole cards and the community cards to form their hands

**Card Rankings**:
- Standard poker hand rankings apply
- When comparing identical hands, standard tie-breaking rules apply
- Since there are no jokers in this variant, Five of a Kind is not possible

**Variations**:
- **Regret Draft**: After discards are revealed, players take turns drafting community cards
- **Regret Choice**: Each player designates one of their discards to be played at a specific position (flop, turn, river)
- **Regret Memory**: Players must announce what they're discarding before placing in the pile
- **Regret Peek**: Before the flop, each player may look at one random card from the community pile

**Edge Cases & Troubleshooting**:
- **Insufficient Discards**: If players can't discard enough cards (in smaller games), dealer adds random cards from the deck
- **Deck Depletion**: For larger games with many discards, two decks may be needed
- **Card Recognition**: Players should not mark cards to recognize their discards
- **Dealer Participation**: If dealer is playing, they must discard before shuffling the community pile
- **Uneven Discards**: All players must discard the same number of cards regardless of position or stack size

**Strategy Notes**:
- Strategic discarding becomes crucial
- Consider discarding cards that would create favorable community combinations
- Pay attention to what others might be discarding
- Discard cards that would help opponents more than yourself

### Cross Joker

**Description**: A variant with jokers arranged in a cross pattern.

**Setup**:
- 5 cards are drawn from the deck and arranged in a cross pattern
- Players must choose either the 3 vertical or 3 horizontal cards as jokers

**Rules**:
- Once a player chooses vertical or horizontal, they must use those cards as jokers for the remainder of the hand
- Players can make different choices (some may choose vertical, others horizontal)
- The chosen jokers function as standard jokers

**Card Rankings**:
- Standard poker hand rankings apply with Five of a Kind possible
- When comparing identical hands with jokers, the player using fewer jokers wins
- For hands with the same number of jokers, standard tie-breaking rules apply
- Five of a Kind hands are ranked by the card value they represent

**Variations**:
- **Binding Cross**: All players must use the same row (majority vote or dealer's choice)
- **Shifting Cross**: After the flop, players can switch which row they're using
- **Expanding Cross**: Start with a 3-card cross, then add two more cards to complete the cross on the turn
- **Double Cross**: Two separate crosses, one for jokers and one for special cards like Cobras

**Edge Cases & Troubleshooting**:
- **Center Card Dispute**: The center card belongs to both rows and can be used regardless of choice
- **Row Declaration**: Players must declare their row choice before seeing any more cards
- **Tie in Declaration**: If there's a tie in players choosing rows, the dealer breaks the tie
- **Card Replacement**: If a cross card is accidentally exposed early, replace it and reshuffle
- **Cross Configuration**: The cross must be properly aligned and visible to all players

**Strategy Notes**:
- Evaluate which line (vertical or horizontal) contains cards most beneficial to your hand
- Consider what your opponents might choose and how it affects the available card pool
- Watch for patterns in opponents' choices to predict their hands

### Cross Community/Joker

**Description**: A complex variant with 9 cards in a cross pattern serving dual purposes.

**Setup**:
- 9 cards are arranged in a cross pattern (5 in one direction, 5 in the other, with 1 card at the intersection)
- Cards are revealed in sequence:
  1. First 3 cards in each direction (6 total)
  2. 1 more card in each direction (2 total)
  3. The center card last

**Rules**:
- Players can designate one row as jokers and use the other row as community cards
- The dealer decides whether the center card is a joker, community card, or player's choice
- Each player makes their best hand using their hole cards, chosen community cards, and available jokers
- Players can change which row they're using as jokers or community cards at any time until the final showdown

**Card Rankings**:
- Standard poker hand rankings apply with Five of a Kind possible
- When comparing identical hands, the player using fewer jokers wins
- For hands with the same number of jokers, standard tie-breaking rules apply
- Five of a Kind hands are ranked by the card value they represent
- Royal flushes with jokers are ranked lower than natural royal flushes

**Variations**:
- **Committed Cross**: Players must declare their row choice after seeing only the first 6 cards
- **Blind Center**: The center card remains face-down until showdown
- **Community Only**: Both rows are community cards, but players can only use one row in their final hand
- **Extended Cross**: Use 11 cards (5 in each direction plus the center) for a larger decision space

**Edge Cases & Troubleshooting**:
- **Center Card Designation**: Clarify before the game starts how the center card will be designated
- **Row Switching**: Set clear rules about when players can change their row choice
- **Simultaneous Reveal**: To prevent strategic timing of row choices, players should reveal choices simultaneously
- **Dealer Advantage**: If dealer decides center card designation, they should announce it before seeing any cards
- **Odd Number of Players**: For voting on center card designation, establish tiebreaker rules
- **Information Sharing**: Players should not reveal their row choice until showdown
- **Multiple Row Changes**: Limit number of times a player can change rows to prevent abuse

**Strategy Notes**:
- The choice between which row becomes jokers vs. community is critical
- Consider both the value of specific community cards and the flexibility offered by jokers
- Pay attention to how the center card is designated, as it can belong to both rows
- The ability to change your decision adds significant strategic depth
- Watch for patterns in your opponents' betting that might reveal their row choices

### Triangle Joker

**Description**: A variant with jokers arranged in a triangle pattern.

**Setup**:
- 9 cards are drawn and arranged in a triangle pattern with 3 cards on each side of the perimeter (forming an equilateral triangle)
- Players must choose one side/row of the triangle to use as jokers

**Rules**:
- Available rows are the three sides of the triangle, each containing 3 cards
- Once chosen, those cards function as jokers for the remainder of the hand
- Players can choose different rows from each other

**Card Rankings**:
- Standard poker hand rankings apply with Five of a Kind possible
- When comparing identical hands with jokers, the player using fewer jokers wins
- For hands with the same number of jokers, standard tie-breaking rules apply
- Five of a Kind hands are ranked by the card value they represent

**Variations**:
- **Triangle Twist**: Players must switch their chosen row after the flop
- **Triangle Corners**: The three corner cards are special jokers with additional powers
- **Rotating Triangle**: After each betting round, the triangle rotates, changing which cards are in which rows
- **Hidden Triangle**: Some cards in the triangle remain face-down until selected

**Edge Cases & Troubleshooting**:
- **Card Ownership**: Cards at the corners belong to both adjacent rows and can be used by players who choose either row
- **Declaration Timing**: Players must declare their chosen row before seeing community cards
- **Row Recognition**: Clearly mark or arrange the rows to prevent confusion
- **Identical Choices**: Multiple players can choose the same row
- **Dealer Participation**: If dealer is playing, they should declare their choice before dealing community cards
- **Triangle Configuration**: Ensure the triangle is clearly visible and properly formed for all players
- **Missing Cards**: If the deck runs short of cards, establish priority (triangle first, then community, then hole cards)

**Strategy Notes**:
- Consider your existing hand when choosing which row offers the most benefit
- Watch for patterns in which sides other players tend to choose
- Be mindful of corner cards that may benefit multiple players

### Dynamic Range

**Description**: A variant where the joker range changes as players fold.

**Setup**:
- Begin with a standard Range Jokers setup
- When a player folds, their cards establish a new range for jokers

**Rules**:
- When a player folds, their hole cards are revealed
- The ranks of these cards create a new range, and all cards within that range become jokers
- The same rules for inclusive/exclusive and short/long range apply
- Only the most recent fold's range is active - each new fold overwrites the previous range
- There is only one active range at any time

**Card Rankings**:
- Standard poker hand rankings apply with Five of a Kind possible
- When comparing identical hands, the player using fewer jokers wins
- For hands with the same number of jokers, standard tie-breaking rules apply
- Five of a Kind hands are ranked by the card value they represent

**Variations**:
- **Historic Range**: All folded cards create ranges, with newest ranges taking precedence over older ones
- **Range War**: Players vote on whether to use the short or long range after each fold
- **Protected Range**: Once established, the range cannot change until after the next community card
- **Dynamic Scaling**: The joker power scales based on how many folds have occurred

**Edge Cases & Troubleshooting**:
- **First Fold Timing**: No jokers exist until the first player folds
- **Simultaneous Folds**: Establish order for processing multiple folds in the same round
- **Fold Verification**: All folded cards must be shown face up to all players
- **Range Reset**: When a new hand begins, any previous range is nullified
- **No Valid Range**: If folded cards create no valid range (e.g., two identical cards in exclusive mode), the previous range remains active
- **Dealer Folds**: If dealer folds, their cards set the range like any other player
- **Missing Cards**: Replace any missing cards from the deck if needed for the range determination

**Strategy Notes**:
- Strategic folding becomes a key part of the game
- Consider how your fold might create advantageous or disadvantageous jokers for remaining players
- Remember that only the most recent fold affects the game state
- This creates interesting dynamics where players might fold specifically to change the range

**Done Group Insight**: *"Dynamic Range came from Swapnil's idea that 'your failures should help others.' Ironically, he's the most strategic folder in the group now. One time, Saksham was crushing everyone with a perfect range of jokers when Dhruv deliberately folded a seemingly good hand just to reset the range and ruin Saksham's strategy. The revenge fold is now a legitimate tactic in our games."*

## COMBINED VARIANTS

The variations described above can be combined to create even more complex and strategic games. When combining variants, establish clear rules for any potential conflicts before beginning play.

### Basic Combinations

- **AK47 with Range Jokers**: More cards and jokers lead to incredibly strong hands
- **Regret Jokers with Cross Community**: Players discard to create jokers while also establishing part of the cross
- **Triangle Joker with Special Cards**: Add Cobra, Viper, BS, or Mamba cards for even more strategic depth

**Done Group Insight**: *"Our most infamous night involved 'The Perfect Storm' â€“ a combination of Triangle Cobra, Regret Jokers, and a Mamba accumulation that had reached 5 cards. Saksham somehow drew both a Mamba and three Cobras in one hand. The resulting chaos ended with Swapnil flipping the table (accidentally!) and Shivam declaring it 'the greatest poker hand in history.' We still talk about it years later."*

### Meta-Variations

These variations substitute different special card types into the basic variant structures:

#### Snake Card Substitutions

Any variant that uses jokers can substitute snake cards instead. For example:

- **Regret Cobra**: Players discard one card each, and those become Cobra cards
- **Range Vipers**: Two cards determine a range, and all cards in that range become Viper cards
- **Cross BS**: Players choose either vertical or horizontal row of cards to be BS cards
- **Triangle Cobra**: Players choose one row of the triangle to be their Cobra cards
- **Cross Mamba**: Cards arranged in a cross with one row becoming Mamba cards (extremely rare and powerful)
- **Dynamic Range Gecko**: As players fold, their cards establish ranges for Wild (Gecko) cards

#### Mixed Special Card Variants

Different special card types can be used within the same variant structure:

- **Mixed Cross**: In a cross pattern, vertical cards become one type (e.g., Jokers) and horizontal become another (e.g., Cobras)
- **Tiered Triangle**: Each row of the triangle represents a different special card (e.g., top = Mamba, middle = Viper, bottom = Cobra)
- **Stratified Range**: Different sections of the range become different special cards (e.g., first half = Jokers, second half = Vipers)

### Full Permutation Table

Below is a comprehensive table of all possible permutations combining base variants with special card types:

| Base Variant | Joker | Cobra | Viper | BS | Mamba | Gecko |
|--------------|-------|-------|-------|----|----|-------|
| AK47 | AK47 Joker | AK47 Cobra | AK47 Viper | AK47 BS | AK47 Mamba | AK47 Gecko |
| Range | Range Joker | Range Cobra | Range Viper | Range BS | Range Mamba | Range Gecko |
| Regret | Regret Joker | Regret Cobra | Regret Viper | Regret BS | Regret Mamba | Regret Gecko |
| Cross | Cross Joker | Cross Cobra | Cross Viper | Cross BS | Cross Mamba | Cross Gecko |
| Triangle | Triangle Joker | Triangle Cobra | Triangle Viper | Triangle BS | Triangle Mamba | Triangle Gecko |
| Dynamic | Dynamic Joker | Dynamic Cobra | Dynamic Viper | Dynamic BS | Dynamic Mamba | Dynamic Gecko |

Additionally, multi-row configurations are possible where different special card types operate in parallel:

| Configuration | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Triple-5 | 5 community cards + 5 cobra cards + 5 joker cards (revealed like flop, turn, river) |
| Triple-Cross | Cross pattern for community + Cross pattern for cobra + Cross pattern for jokers |
| Triangle-Plus | Triangle pattern with different special card for each side |
| Range-Split | Range determining cards for two different special card types simultaneously |
| Full Snake Pit | Parallel rows for all snake cards (Cobra, Viper, BS) with community cards |

**Done Group Insight**: *"The night we tried the Triple-5 with all snake cards, Saksham needed a dedicated notepad just to keep track of all the possible combinations. Swapnil nearly had an aneurysm when Dhruv played both a Cobra and a BS card in the same hand. 'This isn't poker anymore,' he complained. 'It's psychological warfare!'"*

### Complex Multi-Mechanic Variations

These variations combine multiple base mechanics:

- **Regret-Cross**: Players discard cards that form a cross pattern, choosing one direction as special cards
- **Range-Triangle**: Two cards determine a range, and those cards are arranged in a triangle
- **Dynamic-Regret**: Players discard to create special cards, but folded cards can change the effective cards
- **AK47-Triangle**: Extra cards in play with a triangle of special cards to choose from
- **Cross-Dynamic**: A cross pattern of cards that changes as players fold
- **Regret-Range**: Players discard to establish the boundaries of a special card range
- **Triple-5 Setup**: A complex setup with 5 community cards, 5 cobra cards, and 5 joker cards, each revealed in sequence similar to flop, turn, and river phases, creating three parallel rows of cards that interact with each other

### Special Rules for Multi-Mechanic Games

When playing combined variants:

1. **Precedence Order**: Establish which mechanics take priority when conflicts arise
2. **Card Assignment**: Decide whether a single card can have multiple special properties
3. **Timing Rules**: Determine when each special ability can be activated
4. **Balance Adjustments**: Consider adjusting betting structures to accommodate the increased complexity

When combining variants, ensure all players understand the complete ruleset before beginning play.
